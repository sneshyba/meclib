    "## The terrestrial sequestration feedback\n",
    "In previous versions of Cambio, the atmosphere-to-land carbon flux was calculated as $F_{atm->land} = k_{al0} +  k_{al1} \\times [C_{atm}]$, in which $k_{al1}$ was described as a measure of the strength of Earth's natural $CO_2$ fertilization capability. Because this capability is a free ecosystem service provided by (mostly) forest photosynthesis, part of Earth system stewardship would be to help ensure that $k_{al1}$ stays high. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is evidence, however, that $k_{al1}$ is getting smaller with increasing global temperature. Since that reduction itself drives increasing temperatures, we can understand it as a feedback mechanism -- which we'll call the \"terrestrial sequestration feedback\" (or TSF) effect. In Cambio 4.0, we'll represent this reduction algorithmically by multiplying $k_{al1}$ by a sigmoid function whose value drops from a pre-industrial value of 1, to a smaller value in a warmer world. Thus, the equations of Cambio 4.0 are written\n",

    "F_{land->atm} =  k_{la} \\ \\ \\ (1) \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",

    "F_{atm->land} = k_{al0} +  k_{al1} \\times [C_{atm}] \\times  \\sigma_{floor}(T_{anomaly})  \\ \\ \\ (2)\n",

    "The chief challenge in this approach consists of finding realistic values of parameters that control $\\sigma_{floor}(T_{anomaly})$. As you will probably recall, there are (generically) three of these:\n",
    "- $T_{anomaly}^*$, the tipping point temperature at which $\\sigma_{floor}(T_{anomaly})$ transitions from its pre-industrial to its post-warming value.\n",
    "- $\\Delta T$, a measure of the abruptness of that transition\n",
    "- $\\sigma_{floor}$, the post-warming (smaller) value of $\\sigma$\n",
    "\n",
    "Recently, Ke et al, 2024 (https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12447) have documented declining rates of atmosphere-to-land carbon flux, including an abrupt reduction in the year 2023. Geographically, it appears that reduction in the rate of sequestration in the Amazon basin is chiefly responsible. More to our present purpose, the paper describes these declining rates in a way that enables us to assign realistic values to $T_{anomaly}^*$, $\\Delta T$, and $\\sigma_{floor}$. That means we have everything we need to move forward with adding terrestrial sequestration feedback to our model. \n",
    "\n",
    "## The idea of this CGI\n",
    "Here, the idea is to see how addition of the terrestrial sequestration feedback mechanism affects the magnitude and timing of peak warming. To facilitate this, the process of running our Cambio simulations has been greatly streamlined. Although doing so comes at the cost of burying the algorithms inside Python libraries, it makes everything a lot easier to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Uploading your climate emissions scenario\n",
    "As before, you'll need to upload a climate emissions scenario file to the current folder. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning goals\n",
    "1. I can describe the terrestrial sequestration feedback (TSF) mechanism, and the parameters ($T_{anomaly}^*$, $\\Delta T$, and $\\sigma_{floor}$) that parameterize it.\n",
    "1. I can explain how it happens that while the impact of feedbacks such as the TSF can be estimated from the parameters, only an integrated simulation can provide its full impact.\n",
    "1. I can describe how TSF affects key climate predictions, including the magnitude and timing of anthropogenic maximum warming."
