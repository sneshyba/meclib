    "## Introduction\n",
    "Here, we're going to focus on the accumulated sum of emissions over time, written mathematically as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "E(t) = \\int_{-\\infty}^t \\epsilon(t) \\ dt \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ (1)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\epsilon(t)$ is the annual emission rate we created in ScheduledFlows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why would we care about this accumulation? There's a school of thought in climate science, that what really counts is not so much how much carbon goes into the air any given year, but total amount humans put there.\n",
    "\n",
    "There's an easy way to do this integration in Python. The key is a numpy function called \"np.cumsum,\" which adds up the emissions year after year. To convert the result of np.cumsum into a total accumulated emission in GtC, we need to multiply it by the time interval between steps in the array we're using to represent the emissions. Details are given in the code below.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "- I can use pandas and dictionaries to read data with metadata.\n",
    "- I can use np.cumsum to numerically integrate a function.\n",
    "- I am familiar with quantitative features of cumulative anthropogenic carbon emissions."
